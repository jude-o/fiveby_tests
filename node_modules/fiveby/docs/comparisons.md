currently all known peers have only a small subset of the following:

- architecture/platform agnostic
- uses the only selenium supported node driver and existing "standard" libs for testing
- provides a test runner, reporter, best practices, and the testing api

- works on all the browsers supported by selenium which is by far the largest set
- simple codebase
